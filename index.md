# Blockchain Naming Systems

This archive contains a series of reports on various Blockchain (and
Blockchain-adjacent) Naming Systems, primarily authored by [Nicholas
Weaver](mailto://nweaver@icsi.berkeley.edu.com).  This work was sponsored by
[ICANN](https://www.icann.org) but all opinions are those of the
author, not of the funder.

This archive is designed as a living and updateable set of documents
contained in the Github repo
[nweaver-blockchain/blockchain-names](https://github.com/nweaver-blockchain/blockchain-names/).
Any suggestions or edits should be constructed into a pull request for
evaluation and inclusion.
